# Intelligence transportation system
Our project idea is to solve the Travelling Salesman problem, this problem
appears in Companies that have transportation system and want to minimize
the cost of delivering the orders, and this is done by providing the correct
order in which distributers should deliver orders

# actors
We have 3 actors { Customer, Provider, Distributer }
